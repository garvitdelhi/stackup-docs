# Introduction

At Stackup, we believe that everyone should have access to a fair and open financial system. But most people haven't tried cryptocurrency yet because it seems too complicated and risky. That's why we are creating a digital wallet that is designed for regular people.

Stackup enables users & developers to onboard their users on smart contract wallets. Most wallets on Ethereum today have a single point of failure, their mnemonic. These wallets have a single private key which is derived from the mnemonic and has full access to the user's wallet, i.e. an Externally Owned Account (EOAs). However, Stackup is a Smart Contract Wallet which lets users access their funds through username and password. Users can also set their Guardians, which are wallets that you trust to help you unlock your account if you lose your username or password.
